#Resources
I worked with student Jen Liu and TA Jim Dykes on this program.

Here's a list of the web resources that I used, and the portion of the project they helped me with:
* http://dataforradicals.com/2017/03/20/the-absurdly-illustrated-guide-to-your-first-d3-scatterplot/ - building a scatterplot
* https://keithpblog.org/post/upgrading-d3-from-v3-to-v4/ - v3 to v4 conversions
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38391411/what-is-the-d3-js-v4-0-equivalent-for-d3-scale-category10 - scale in v4
* http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/5987480 - multiple graphs side-by-side
* http://bl.ocks.org/jfreels/6811998 - mouseover functionality
* https://bl.ocks.org/anonymous/e88acea4307a96d5e267daaf737192e6 - sorting (needed for line graph)
* http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/4414436 - building a simple line graph
* https://fonts2u.com/jurassic-park.font - Jurassic Park font

#Bells and whistles
I completed the following bells and whistles:
* Tooltips
* Styling - I chose to use a theme based on colors and fonts from "Jurassic Park." Note that numbers in this font are portrayed as tally marks. This isn't the most user-friendly representation, but it does make you stop and pause, thus spending more time with the graphic. The dinosaur watermark is actually a character (* and #).
* Replication

#Replication
I created my replications using Excel. The basic method was: import the data files, create graphs using the data --> insert scatterplot features, style with the Excel WYSIWIG.
I found that it was much easier to import and select the data, because I'm very familiar with spreadsheets. In D3, loading and selecting the data, and getting the correct data to populate the corresponding graph, was a huge hurdle.
However, I was surprised to find that it was actually much easier to style the graphs in D3 than in Excel.
In D3, I could explicitly specify color, size, shape, etc., whereas in Excel I had to fiddle with windows and dig through an interface to find exactly what I wanted to reset.
Also, I like how the styling conventions matched the graphic design language that I am accustomed to from working with vector graphics in Illustrator.
